# MACI
Machine learning-based Antibiotic resistance gene-specific drug Class Identification.
Here, we are presenting a model, MACI (Machine learning-based Antibiotic resistance gene-specific drug Class Identification) that can take metagenomic fragments as input and predict the drug class of antibiotic resistant genes. Our proposed model is an artificial neural network (ANN)-based algorithm with a deep architecture. Through its hidden layer network, it can effectively capture significant patterns that enable accurate classification of drug categories. The model takes fragments of metagenomic sequences as input, leveraging the diversity of genomic sequences for training and predicting drug classes. After curating the ARG sequence data, the whole sequence reads were fragmented into short lengths, encoded, and used to train and optimize the network parameters.
