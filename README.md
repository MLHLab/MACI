# MACI
Machine learning-based Antibiotic resistance gene-specific drug Class Identification.

Here, we are presenting a model, MACI (Machine learning-based Antibiotic resistance gene-specific drug Class Identification) that can take metagenomic fragments as input and predict the drug class of antibiotic resistant genes. Our proposed model is an artificial neural network (ANN)-based algorithm with a deep architecture. Through its hidden layer network, it can effectively capture significant patterns that enable accurate classification of drug categories. The model takes fragments of metagenomic sequences as input, leveraging the diversity of genomic sequences for training and predicting drug classes. After curating the ARG sequence data, the whole sequence reads were fragmented into short lengths, encoded, and used to train and optimize the network parameters. 

Schematic of the developed model, MACI, is depicted in Figure 1. For this work, we utilized the well-known Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) for ARG sequence retrieval. A recent comparative analysis of 12 antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) databases revealed that CARD offers an extensive coverage of genes. As a result, it can be considered a well-established and reliable resource for sequence data. The Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) serves as the annotation tool used in CARD, available in both web-interface and downloadable command-line software formats. The ARG sequences (acquired from CARD) were first checked for redundancy removal to identify potentially discriminating sequences corresponding to different drug classes. Post to fragmentation of the sequences and data pre-processing, the dataset was divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) groups. A deep ANN-based supervised learner was developed and trained using the training data. The testing counterpart was used for performance measurement of the model. After thorough training and testing, our computational framework achieved accurate characterization of drug classes for ARGs.
